Week 1

What we did to start off with was deleting our old repository what I did was renamed it "b" and then I went to the bottom and deleted it. The reason we deleted it was because the jekyll was old so didn't work. 

What we then did was found jekyll now then we forked it. After that we renamed our repository and then set about finding an avatar. Our teacher said we can't use gifs because they are annoying.
