We learned that all numbers are made up of the displayed number * the base value. So for example 5102 is actually 5* 1000 + 1* 100 + 0 * 10 + 2 * 1. 

Using this logic we learned binary.  Binary is actually really simple as the displayed number is either a 1 or a 0, how binary works is that starting for 1 the base value always double so is 1,2,4,8 etc. This means that 1001 in binary is one thousand & one it is instead 1*8 + 1*1 = 9. You can always tell if the binary number is even or odd because it is even it ends in a zero it is even an if it ends in a 1 it's odd. We also learned the names of certain part of a number. For example, 10010101 is called a bite because it contains 8 numbers. 1001 & 0101 are each nibble because they contain 4 numbers & each 1 & 0 is called a bit because they each contain 1 number 

We also learned hex. It was a normal contain system be it goes up to 16. 1-9 are all normal but A =10 B=11 C=12 â€¦ and F=16. When converting between Hex & binary it is actually really easy because: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Binary 
Hex</td>
    <td>128
16*4</td>
    <td>64
16*3</td>
    <td>32
16*2</td>
    <td>16
16*1</td>
    <td>8
8</td>
    <td>4
4</td>
    <td>2
2</td>
    <td>1
1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


 

From this you can tell that in AB = 1010 1011 because for each hex symbol you just work it out in the first nibble of binary then place it where you need to
