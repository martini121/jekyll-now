Making fancy letters

In today's lesson we used repl.it to make a 1D, 2D, & 3D T. The first T was very simple. The second T was more challenging however when I got the hang of it i found it quite easy. One thing I struggled with was I forgot that a 2D T has a wide stem so on my first try the stem was thin like a stick. With the 3D T I used trial & error however i found out that many of the angles were the same. This is my repl.it <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@LukeMartin2/Writing-Letters?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
