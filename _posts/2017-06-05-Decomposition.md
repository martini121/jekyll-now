We learnt today about what decomposition is. Decomposition is basically planning the code before you write it. We also learnt that there are loads of intricate detail that goes into doing a simple task for example pouring water into a kettle. We also learnt that there are local & global variables which. You make your own local variable but with the global variable there are libraries which would have the word print & then a set code so all we have to is type print
