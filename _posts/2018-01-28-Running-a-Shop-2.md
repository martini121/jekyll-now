  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson we look at the more realistic shop </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>This included adding in stuff such as The amount of stock, Sold stock unsold stock, cost of buying, Overall cost,  Profit per item, Overall revenue & Overall profit. Most of it was quite easy however we added in conditional formatting.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>To add Conditional formatting you have to Right click and scroll down & it will be under Data Validation
   Selection screen pops up. You can select the condition by clicking the box under "Format cells ifâ€¦" Then a selection of options pop up. You select one & then decide what the cell will look like if it complies with the condition I used the highlight button  after that you keep on adding rules then select done when finished. All your rules come up you can just leave & they will be saved or you can change some then leave.  </td>
  </tr>
