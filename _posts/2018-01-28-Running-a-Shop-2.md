In this lesson we look at the more realistic shop 

This included adding in stuff such as The amount of stock, Sold stock unsold stock, cost of buying, Overall cost,  Profit per item, Overall revenue & Overall profit. Most of it was quite easy however we added in conditional formatting.

To add Conditional formatting you have to Right click and scroll down & it will be under Data Validation

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/dPzkrZj0bnd4u7DuJqSe8g_img_0.png)   Selection screen pops up. You can select the condition by clicking the box under "Format cells ifâ€¦"![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/dPzkrZj0bnd4u7DuJqSe8g_img_1.png) Then a selection of options pop up. You select one & then decide what the cell will look like if it complies with the condition I used the highlight button ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/dPzkrZj0bnd4u7DuJqSe8g_img_2.png) after that you keep on adding rules then select done when finished. All your rules come up you can just leave & they will be saved or you can change some then leave.
